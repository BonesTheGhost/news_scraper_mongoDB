# news_scraper_mongoDB
HW for week 18.

*UPDATED README AND ADDED gitignore TO TEST GIT PUSH.*

Due to the time constraints on this homework, I wanted to at least document ALL of the efforts put forward to learn the material and make something that functions. I believe I have in multiple pieces, a functioning cheerio scraper, a functioniing web app that CAN request information from my MongoDB database and display it on a web page. I also have in the 'demo_cheerio' folder a small scraper that scrapes my own HW6 giphy page; it helped me understand what cheerios purpose is through a simple scrape of the search-section container on my page.

Things that I have gotten working so far::
1. A basic express app with information being requested from MongoDB.
2. A basic cheerio scraper that pulls info successfully from a page.
3. My Handlebars homework, showing that I can indeed pass information from a database (MySQL) to a front-end.

I will be attempting to combine the various pieces of these programs to complete the MongoDB HW.
